# Pimped out WordPress configuration file
Hi! I'm a highly customized configuration file for WordPress. I contain several key elements that can help you operate a smoother experience for your audience and I do it all behind the scenes!

Do not take me at face value. I contain a lot of features that are used especially by my creator. Instead, feel free to use me to draw upon what you feel you need to help your WordPress installation become better!

If you do decide to use me in full, you do so at your own risk! But if you're here, you're probably smart enough to understand how to properly use and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
