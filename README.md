# Pimped out WordPress configuration file
Hi! I'm a highly customized configuration file for WordPress. I contain several key elements that can help you operate a smoother experience for your audience and I do it all behind the scenes!

Do not take me at face value as I contain a lot of features that are used specifically by my creator for his creations. Instead, feel free to use me to draw upon what you feel you need to help your WordPress installation become better!

If you do decide to use me as is then you do so at your own risk! But if you're here, you're probably smart enough to understand how to properly use this information and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

Grab a copy of me and have fun!
